\section{The Born-Oppenheimer Approximation}
Molecular physics explains the origin of chemical bonds and makes it possible to understand quantum chemistry calculations.
Chemistry can be represented by an "unsolvable" Schr\"odinger equation:

$$\bigg[-\sum_{q=1}^{N_{\alpha}}\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_{\alpha}}\cdot\nabla_{\alpha}^2-\sum_{i=0}^{N_e}\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\cdot\nabla^2_i+V[\{\vec{R}\}_{\alpha},\{\vec{r_i}\}_i]\bigg]=E\psi[\{\vec{R}\}_{\alpha},\{\vec{r}\}_i]$$

$$V[\{\vec{R}\}_{\alpha},\{\vec{r}_i\}]=\bigg(\sum_{i<j}\frac{e^2}{|\vec{r_i}-\vec{r_j}|}+\sum_{\alpha<\beta}\frac{z_{\alpha}z_{\beta}e^2}{|\vec{R_{\alpha}}-\vec{R_{\beta}}|}-\sum_{i,\alpha}\frac{e^2z_{\alpha}}{|\vec{r_i}-\vec{R_{\alpha}}|}\bigg)$$

In order, the different parts of the equation represent:

\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $-\sum_{q=1}^{N_{\alpha}}\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_{\alpha}}\cdot\nabla_{\alpha}^2$,  Kinetics of nuclei.
		\item $-\sum_{i=0}^{N_e}\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\cdot\nabla^2_i$,  Kinetics of electrons.
		\item $\sum_{i<j}\frac{e^2}{|\vec{r_i}-\vec{r_j}|}$,  Repulsive coulombic interaction between electrons
		\item $\sum_{\alpha<\beta}\frac{z_{\alpha}z_{\beta}e^2}{|\vec{R_{\alpha}}-\vec{R_{\beta}}|}$,  Repulsive coulombic interaction between nuclei.
		\item $-\sum_{i,\alpha}\frac{e^2z_{\alpha}}{|\vec{r_i}-\vec{R_{\alpha}}|}$,  Attractive coulombic interaction between nucleus and electrons.
		\item Curly brackets represent the collection of all $r$ and $R$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

This equation can be approximated by considering that protons are much bigger and slower than electrons, and therefore are fixed.
The Born-Oppenheimer approximation divides these operations in two (\textbf{decoupling}).

	\subsection{Decoupling approach}
	We can implement a \textit{divide et impera} approach.

		\subsubsection{Fixed nuclear configuration}
		First the electronic problem is studied at fixed nuclear configuration (i.e. ignoring the kinetic energy of the nuclei).
		The first fragment is ignored (no motion, no kinetic energy) and the coulombic repulsion becomes constant consequently.
		Nuclei bind only when they are close to each other.

		$$\bigg[-\sum_{i=0}^{N_e}\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\cdot\nabla^2_i+\sum_{i<j}\frac{e^2}{|\vec{r_i}-\vec{r_j}|}-\sum_{i,\alpha}\frac{e^2z_{\alpha}}{|\vec{r_i}-\vec{R_{\alpha}}|}\bigg]\cdot\psi[\{\vec{R}\}_{\alpha},\{\vec{r}\}_i] =E[\{R_{\alpha}\}]\psi[\{\vec{R}\}_{\alpha},\{\vec{r}\}_i]$$

		Where $E[\{R_{\alpha}\}]$ is the energy of the system at a fixed nuclear position, ${R_{\alpha}}$ represents the contributions of the electrons to the potential energy.
		The energy eigenvalue describes the electron density around the nuclei at fixed nuclei positions.
		The fact that there are electrons moving increases the overall potential energy (repulsive interactions), electrons can lower their higher potential energy by tunneling to another nucleus with Pauli symmetry.
		This lowers the total energy of the system and creates bonds.
		Note that this is not a "charge-driven" attraction, but a phenomenon driven by quantum tunnelling and Pauli's symmetry.

		\subsubsection{Dynamics of the nuclei}
		The second step is to solve the dynamics of the nuclei based on their own coulombic interactions and electrons effect.

		$$\bigg[-\sum_{q=1}^{N_{\alpha}}\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_{\alpha}}\cdot\nabla_{\alpha}^2+\sum_{\alpha<\beta}\frac{z_{\alpha}z_{\beta}e^2}{|\vec{R_{\alpha}}-\vec{R_{\beta}}|}+E|\{R_\alpha\}| \bigg]\varphi(|R|)=\varepsilon\varPhi(\{R\})$$

		Note that $\varepsilon$ is a value, not a function, it does not depend on any parameter.
		The quantum effect becomes weaker as the weight of the system increases.

	\subsection{Many-body systems}
	To describe a many-body system, I can replace this Schr\"odinger equation with a Newtonian equation.

	$$M_\alpha\frac{d^2}{dt^2}R_\alpha(t)=-\nabla_\alpha(E(R)+E_t(R))$$

	This equation is fine for describing \textbf{classical molecular simulations}.
	We loose the quantum effects of the nuclei (protonation - quantum tunneling of protons, chemical reactions, $\dots$), and often for molecules a classical formulation is enough.

\section{The H$_2$ molecule}
We are given two protons $(a,b)$ and two electrons $(1,2)$.
Consider the structure of the electronic wave function as $\psi(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2},s_1^z,s_2^z,(\vec{R_a},\vec{R_b}))$ where $(\vec{R_a},\vec{R_b})$ is a fixed external parameter because of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and is the distance between nuclei.
A schematic draw of the problem is depicted in figure \ref{fig:h2}.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{img_8}
	\caption{A representation of the $H_2$ molecule given the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.}
	\label{fig:h2}
\end{figure}

	\subsection{Representation}
	The system can be firstly represented as two atoms at a large distance that approach slowly to each other, generating a linear combination of mean wave functions.
	The electrons are in a superposition of states when they start interacting, so the resulting H-H chemical bond is actually an entangled electron tunnelling.

	$$\psi(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2},s_1^z,s_2^z,(\vec{R_a},\vec{R_b}))=\psi_{\text{spatial}}(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2})\otimes\psi_{\text{spin}}(s_1^z,s_2^z)=\Phi\otimes\mathcal{X}$$

	The wave-function can be factorized, as the Hamiltonian is separable (i.e. does not depend on the spin).

	\subsection{Spin}
	Spins can be $\ket{\uparrow\uparrow}$, $\ket{\downarrow\downarrow}$, $\ket{\uparrow\downarrow}$, and $\ket{\downarrow\uparrow}$.
	Since electrons are fermions, the two spins' product must be antisymmetric, hence one of the two spins must be antisymmetric and the other one must be symmetric (the two possibilities are spatial symmetry and spin antisymmetric or spatial antisymmetry and symmetric spin).
	Symmetry can be evaluated in entangled states, too.

	\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{itemize}
		 \item \textbf{Symmetric spin ($J=1$)}: $\ket{\uparrow\uparrow}$, $\ket{\downarrow\downarrow}$, $\frac{\ket{\uparrow\downarrow}+\ket{\downarrow\uparrow}}{\sqrt{2}}$ also called \textbf{triplet state} (quantum state of a system with a spin quantum number $s=1$), molecule bends in Stern-Gerlach.
		 \item \text{Antisymmetric spin ($J=0$)}: $\frac{\ket{\uparrow\downarrow}-\ket{\downarrow\uparrow}}{\sqrt{2}}$ also called \textbf{singlet state} (total spin angular moment $s=0$), molecule doesn't bend in Stern-Gerlach.
	\end{itemize}
	\end{multicols}

	The result is that a combination of two spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles can carry a total spin of $1$ or $0$, depending on whether they occupy a triplet or singlet state.

	\subsection{Model}
	Now we can generate now a model through a variational ansatz:

	$$\psi=\Phi \mathcal{X}=\begin{cases}\psi_1=\Phi_S \mathcal{X}_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\varphi_a(r_{1a}) \varphi_b (r_{1b})+\varphi_a (r_{2a}) \varphi_b (r_{2b})\big) \otimes\frac{\ket{\uparrow\downarrow}-\ket{\downarrow\uparrow}}{\sqrt{2}}\\\psi_2=\Phi_A\mathcal{X}_S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\varphi_a(r_{1a}) \varphi_b (r_{1b})+\varphi_a (r_{2a}) \varphi_b (r_{2b})\big) \otimes\frac{\ket{\uparrow\downarrow}+\ket{\downarrow\uparrow}}{\sqrt{2}}\\\end{cases}$$

	The latter is a mean field model where E1 lives in P1 and E2 lives in P2.
	By the variational principle, the wavefunction with the lowest value of energy is the one that best approximates the H$_2$ atom.

	$$\hat{H}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla_n^2-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla_e^2-\frac{e^2}{|r_1a|}-\frac{e^2}{|r_1b|}-\frac{e^2}{|r_2a|}-\frac{e^2}{|r_2b|}-\frac{e^2}{|R_ab|}$$

	Even if spin is not involved in the Hamiltonian and eventually results in $\braket{\hat{S}}{\hat{S}}=1$, the sign of the expected value of the Hamiltonian depends on the spin symmetry, because spatial value and spin symmetry are entangled.

	\begin{multicols}{2}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $E_1=\langle{\psi_1\,|\,\hat{H}\,|\,\psi_1}\rangle =\langle{\Phi_S\,|\,\hat{H}\,|\,\Phi_S}\rangle$
			\item $E_2=\langle{\psi_2\,|\,\hat{H}\,|\,\psi_2}\rangle=\langle{\Phi_A\,|\,\hat{H}\,|\,\Phi_A}\rangle$
		\end{itemize}
	\end{multicols}

	We must solve, then,

	$$E_1=\frac{1}{2}\int d\vec{r_1}\int d\vec{r_2}\,\big[\varphi(|\vec{r_1}-\vec{R_a}|)\varphi(|\vec{r_2}-\vec{R_b}|)+\varphi(|\vec{r_1}-\vec{R_b}|)\varphi(|\vec{r_2}-\vec{R_a}|)\big](\hat{H})(\Phi_S)$$

	And same for $E_2$.
	There are 6-dimensions functions in 6-dimensions integrals.
	Results are different whether the equations are solved for the first or second electron.

		\subsubsection{Distance of the atoms}
		This is the result that is obtained when the two atoms are infinitely far.

		$$\braket{\,|\,\hat{H}\,|\,}_{S/A}=2E_0\pm\text{stuff}$$

		Else, if the two atoms start to approach,

		$$\braket{\,|\,\hat{H}\,|\,}_{S/A}=\frac{e^2}{R_{ab}}\pm\text{separated ground states}$$

	\subsection{Results}
	We obtain two different functions, depicted in figure \ref{fig:variational}:

	\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Symmetric spatial function}: spin $0$ state, has a lower energy value that corresponds to an optimal distance between the two nuclei $\bar{R}$.
	It allows different calculable energy levels, bond oscillations and strength.
	Important to notice is that \textbf{quantum symmetry} (state $s=0$) is key to the binding of atoms.
		\item \textbf{Antisymmetric spatial function}: goes against the variational approximation, but technically is a right solution from a quantum mechanical point of view.
	\end{itemize}
	\end{multicols}

	\begin{figure}[htbp!]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{img_9}
		\caption{The total energy is: $|E \rangle = \langle \psi | H | \psi \rangle = 2E_0 + \frac{e^2}{R_{ab}} \text{+ other factors}$.
							$E_0$ corresponds tot the energy of two atoms infinitely far away from each others, while $\frac{e^2}{R_{ab}}$ acts when the two atoms start to approach.}
		\label{fig:variational}
	\end{figure}

\section{Electronic structure calculation methods}
When choosing the best method to describe an electronic structure, some evaluations have to be made regarding the accuracy of the calculation with respect to the computational cost of the operation.
The first approximation to be chosen is always the most important, as it determines the further steps that need to be taken.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{img_13}
	\caption{Cartoon representing the main types of calculations, divided based on the cost and accuracy. Exact diagonalization is not reported, since it's computationally extremely hard.}
\label{fig:calculations}
\end{figure}

	The \textbf{exact diagonalization} (truncated basis) technique that we encountered at the beginning of Chapter 5 is also used with very precise outcomes, but it can't be used with systems bearing more than $5$ or $6$ particles at the same time.
	For biological systems, chemical accuracy is important as long as the error is not dramatic (keep in mind that a slight change of temperature can drastically change the system). A simulation is acceptable when $K_BT < 1.5\text{ KJ/mol} \divisionsymbol 2.4 \text{ KJ/mol}$.
	For macromolecules in biology, very accurate DFT are today's state of the art, but they don't predict Van Der Waals dispersion forces, since they have a polynomial form. Instead, other methods are used (\textit{i.e.}, Hartree-Fock).
	In practice, exact solutions for many-body systems are never found but excellent approximations are possible and this is the reason why DFT is the most commonly adopted scheme for electronic calculations in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.
	The general goal is using classical equations to predict quantum-mechanics-descripted movements. In figure \ref{fig:calculations} the main approaches are reported.

	\subsection{Hartree-Fock Method}
	We shall start the discussion about the Hartree-Fock method with the following observation: if the wave function is a sum of decoupled terms, then the wave function solution is a product of single particle wave functions:

	$$H(x_1,.., x_n) = \sum_i \bigg(-\hbar^2 \frac{\nabla_i^2}{2m} + V(x_i) \bigg)$$

	And the solution is in the form

	$$\psi(x_1, ..., x_n) = \phi(x_1) \cdot ... \cdot \phi(x_n) \;\;\;\; (*)$$

	The Hartree method is a variational approach which yields the best solution to a quantum many-body problem in which the ground state trial wave function is in the factored form $(*)$ and Ritz variational principle is applied to determine the “best” single-particle orbitals $\phi(x)$.
	It combines Mean Field Approximation, Fermi symmetry, and the Variational Principle.

		\subsubsection{Slater matrix}
		Hartree Fock uses the Slater matrix's determinant to approximate a set of $N$ fermions.

		$$\psi(q_1\cdots q_n)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}\phi_1(q_1)&\cdots&\phi_n(q_1)\\\cdots & &\cdots\\\phi_1(q_m)&\cdots&\phi_n(q_m)\end{pmatrix}$$

		Where $q_i$ could contain the position and spin or just the position. Anyway, we do not expect to find $\psi(q_1\cdots q_n)$.
		We can however consider it as the result of an equation and calculate the energy by using the Variational Principle with $E=\langle \psi\,|\,E\,|\,\psi \rangle$ and minimize $E$ with respect to $\phi(q)$ (a single-particle function) under the constraint of normalization ($\langle \psi\,|\,\psi \rangle =1$).
		Constraint minimization is operated with \textbf{Lagrange multipliers}: we consider a system of equations $f(x_1...x_n)$ where we can calculate the minimum and the maximum with the application of the gradient $\nabla f=0$.\\

		\subsubsection{Hartree equation}
		We eventually obtain the \textbf{Hartree Equation}, representing \textbf{one electron interacting with a probability cloud}.
		It is a symmetric system (valid for bosons, since they have classical limits and can be represented as shown without further additions):

		$$\bigg(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2_i-\frac{Z}{r_i}\bigg)\Phi_\lambda(\vec{r_i})+\sum_\mu \sum_{j \neq i} \int\,d^3\vec{r_j}\bigg(\Phi^*_\mu(\vec{r_j})\Phi_\mu(\vec{r_j})\frac{1}{|r_i-r_j|}\Phi_\lambda(\vec{r_i})\bigg)=E\Phi_\lambda(\vec{r_i})$$

		In particular:

		\begin{multicols}{2}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $-\frac{Z}{r_i}$ is the coulombic attraction for a single nucleus (atomic physics version)
				\item $\Phi_\lambda(\vec{r_i})$ represents orbital position of the electron + spin. The number of electrons is the number of equations that need to be solved
				\item $\mu$ is the orbital index that changes the wave function
				\item $\Phi^*_\mu(r_j)\Phi_\mu(r_j) = \rho_\mu^{(i)}(r_j)$ is the electron density + density of charge around it (probability density) with sum of all electrons in all orbitals ($\mu$)
			\end{itemize}
		\end{multicols}

		\subsubsection{Fock equation}
		The Fermi symmetry introduces the Slater determinant, that is also called \textbf{exchange term}, which is a repulsive term. (\textbf{Fock equation}).
		This introduction implies that two electrons with the same spin cannot exist in the same orbital.
		The wave function collapses to zero and we obtain a repulsion between the electrons (basically, it would cost infinite energy if the two spins happen to be the same).

		$$\text{HARTREE EQN.}+\sum_\mu \sum_{j \neq i} \int\,d^3\vec{r_j}\bigg(\Phi^*_{\mathcolorbox{yellow}{\mu}}(\vec{r_j})\Phi_{\mathcolorbox{yellow}{\lambda}}(\vec{r_j})\frac{1}{|r_i-r_j|}\Phi_{\mathcolorbox{yellow}{\mu}}(\vec{r_i})\bigg)=E\Phi_\lambda(\vec{r_i})$$

		This implies that the electron density factor ($\varphi^{(1)}_\mu(r_j)$) of the Hartree equation is not present any more ($\varphi^{(2)}_{\mu\lambda}(r_j)$), the two particles are in a different state.
		At the same time, $\Phi_\mu(r_i)$ becomes Fock's generalization exchange term for fermions, generalizing the Hartree Fock to fermions.
		This equation though is non linear ($\Phi^3$).
		However all N functions involve single particles, so we can simply the problem.
		The integral though is 3D, be we can apply nested methods.
		The basis cannot be expanded, diagonalized or transformed by other tricks previously used to simply problems.

		\subsubsection{Self consisted methods}
		Since we can't expand the equation on a different basis, we must use \textbf{self consisted methods}, which are \textbf{iterative} procedures operated until the function converges.

		\begin{multicols}{2}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item (Guess) $\Phi_\lambda (\vec{r})$
				\item Compute $\rho_\mu^{(1)}(\vec{r})$ and $\rho_\mu^{(2)}(\vec{r})$, as they are numerical values
				\item Insert $\rho_\mu^{(1)}(\vec{r})$ and $\rho_\mu^{(2)}(\vec{r})$ into the Hartree Fock equation, resulting in a conventional linear Schr\"odinger equation.
				\item Solve the Hartree Fock equation and get a more accurate wave function $\Phi_\lambda (\vec{r})$
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{multicols}

		The obtained $\Phi_\lambda (\vec{r})$ is a better guess than the initial one, so it is used again for another iteration starting from point $1$ and recomputing the density (this is why the first point of the list is in parenthesis).
		The algorithm will run until convergence is reached and usually a single minimum is present.
		Even with this approach, the computation of Hartree Fock is very expensive.
		For this reason, \textbf{semi-empirical methods} have been developed.
		Coefficients have been introduced in front of direct and exchange terms, that can weight the two terms in order to better match the experimental results.
		The Hartree Fock equation is usually employed to build the expansion of the eigenfunction or in quantum computing.

	\subsection{Density Function Theory (DFT)}
	DTF is a variational approximation which represents a significant improvement with respect to the Hartree Fock method, because \underline{in principle}, it enables for the exact solution of the electronic problem.
	In practice, exact solution are never found.
	However excellent approximations are possible and this is the reason why DFT is the most commonly adopted scheme for electronic calculations in condensed matter and quantum chemistry.
	DTF reaches such excellent results because it fuels the density function (as we'll see later) with \textbf{heuristic} inputs.

		\subsubsection{Density function computation}
		This theory is not based on the wave function computation, but on the \textbf{density function computation}.
		Let the density operator:

		$$\hat{\rho}(\vec{r})=\sum_{i=1}^{N_0}\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r_i})$$

		Its expectation value, assuming $\langle \psi\,|\,\psi \rangle =1$:

		$$\langle \psi\,|\,\hat{\rho}(\vec{r})\,|\,\psi \rangle=\sum_i \int\,d\vec{r_1}...d\vec{r_{N_e}}\bigg(\psi^*(\vec{r_1}-\vec{r_{N_e}})\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r_i})\psi(\vec{r_1}-\vec{r_{N_e}})\bigg)s=n(\vec{r})$$

		Which is the probability of finding any electron at the point $r$.
		This concept is shown in picture \ref{molecule}.

		\begin{figure}[htbp!]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{img_14}
			\caption{In this cartoon of a molecule, the parts with higher probability of finding the electrons are highlighted. Blue parts correspond to low electron density and the red ones to high electron density.}
			\label{molecule}
		\end{figure}

		\subsubsection{Single-body density}
		$n(\vec{r})$ is a so-called \textbf{single-body density}, it doesn't contain the same information of the full wave function (in fact $\hat{\rho}(\vec{r})$ reduces it when compared to $\psi$).
		For any Hamiltonian there is one and only single-body density.\\

		\subsubsection{Hochenberg and Kohn theorems}
		Hochenberg and Kohn have elaborated two theorems that show that the ground state and excited states' properties of a system (quantum many-body system) are entirely determined by the ground-state single body density $n(\vec{r})$.
		Mind that the quantum electronic structure calculation problem is:

		$$\hat{H}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\sum_i^{N_e}\nabla_i^2+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i\neq j} \frac{e^2}{|r_i-r_j|}+\sum_i^{N_e}V_{ext}(\vec{r_i})$$

		The last term is the interaction between single electrons and nuclei.
		In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, this was the external potential as nuclei were fixed.

			\paragraph{First theorem}
			For any system of interacting particles, the external potential is determined uniquely by the ground state one-body density.
			There cannot be two  external potentials which give the same ground-state density.

			$$n_o(\vec{r})=\langle \psi\,|\,\hat{\rho}(\vec{r})\,|\,\psi \rangle$$

				\subparagraph{Corollary}
				All wavefunctions (ground state, first excited state and all eigenstates of $\hat{H}$) are fully determined by $n_0(\vec{r})$.

			\paragraph{Second theorem}
			An energy functional $E[n_0]$ can be defined such that the minimum of this functional with respect to $n_0(\vec{r})$ provides the exact $n_0(\vec{r})$ and $E_0$ (ground state energy).

				\subparagraph{Functionals}
				If a function $f(x):x\rightarrow f(x)$ is such that $x$ is a variable and $f(x)$ a number, a functional $E[f]:f(x)\rightarrow E[f]$ is such that $f(x)$ is a function of operators and $E[f]$ is a number.
				Examples of functionals are definite integrals or the expectation values of operators.
				Anyway, from Ritz Theorem we know that the minimum of the functional of the wave function (i.e., the expectation value of the Hamiltonian) is the exact ground state.

\subsection{Building functionals}
The challenge is therefore to build the energy functional.
The HK theorems would have been relegated as useless curiosity if Kohn and Sham (KS) hadn't found a scheme to construct approximate functionals which turned out to work extremely well for a large class of electronic problems in condensed matter and molecular physics.
The construction of such functionals stands on the so-called KS ansatz for $E[n]$ and is based on the following main assumption: \textit{The ground state of the exact system can be found by minimising the Energy functional for an auxiliary non-interacting system with a local external potential:}

$$H_{aux.} = \sum_i \bigg(-\hbar^2 \frac{\nabla_i^2}{2m} + V_{aux.}(x_i) \bigg)$$

It is possible to define a functional such as the minimum of the functional is the exact value of the ground state energy.
Differently from Ritz Theorem, here the functional is nor given or referred to the wave function.
The one body density's functional's minimum is the exact ground state energy of the problem \textbf{for all} Hamiltonians.

\subsection{Hybrid (QM-MM) Schemes}
Hybrid QM-MM (Quantum Mechanics, Molecular Mechanics) schemes are used for large molecular models and chemical reactions studies like enzymatic reactions.
Quantum mechanics is applied to the region of interest (so to have the computational effort only where needed),  while classical molecular mechanics is applied elsewhere and an hybrid method is used at the border between the two regions.
The difficulty is presented when considering thermodynamics. The more degrees of freedom, the more entropy.
In figure \ref{fig:summary} the main calculation methods we've seen are reported.
